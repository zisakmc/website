# About me!
---

Form where do I start, I don't know. <br>
let's summarizes.
- First of all I am a normal guy just as you are.
- And I am a man of Culture as well, I love Anime.
- I love tech very much 
- I love coding, basically coding is like an art, everybody has an idea but only artist had the ability to express it.
- The world itself also an art, that why everthing on earth we see is beautiful, GOD is also an artist (just my opinion).

## about the website
- This website is a static website.
- I know most of them will not visit, but thats ok for me, I build for my own sake.
- I make this website to help others who has no guide.
- Most of my content will be mixed some will be tutorial and others will be some of my opinion.
